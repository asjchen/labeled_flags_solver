# Labeled Flag Algebra Solver for Multipartite Turan Problem

## Python Requirements
* cvxopt
* Irene
* networkx

## Todo List:
* Flag Algebras
    * write a test suite
    * average a flag graph
* Semidefinite program
    * decide indexing of the decision vector
    * write constraints for nonnegative entries
    * write constraints for summing similar labels to 1
    * (likely) write zero constraints for any graph with nonindependent clusters
    * write constraints for semidefinite matrices
    * write constraints for edge densities
    * write objective
    * solve the problem!
